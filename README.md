# Kyphosis Disease – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🧠📊

This repository contains a practical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using the **Kyphosis Disease Dataset**. Kyphosis is an excessive outward curvature of the spine, causing hunching of the back. The dataset contains information about children who underwent corrective spinal surgery, and this analysis aims to uncover insights from the data using Python and Pandas.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of **81 records and 4 columns**, where:
- `Age`: Age of the patient (in months)
- `Number`: Number of vertebrae involved
- `Start`: Position of the topmost vertebra operated on
- `Kyphosis`: Indicates if kyphosis was present after the operation (`present` or `absent`)

## 📌 Objectives

- Import and explore the dataset with Pandas
- Perform initial data wrangling and cleaning
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Visualize correlations between variables
- Convert data types where necessary
- Summarize insights for medical relevance

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Main Findings

- Correlation analysis between age, number of vertebrae, and kyphosis outcome
- Statistical summary of age including average, minimum, and maximum
- Data visualization to highlight key relationships

## 💡 Conclusion

This project provides a clear example of basic EDA on a medical dataset using pandas and visualization tools. It serves as a foundational step toward deeper predictive analytics and machine learning in the medical domain.
